# AutoPftxsTool
Automatic .pftxs unpacker and repacker.

Works by dragging a .pftxs file onto the tool to unpack it, and dragging an unpacked .pftxs folder onto the tool to repack it.

## Requirements
Requires my build of GzsTool.Core.dll from [here](https://github.com/BobDoleOwndU/GzsTool), and CityHash.
